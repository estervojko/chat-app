Chat App using Web Sockets.

For the final project, I'd like to do a basic chat application, using web sockets protocols, and semantic-ui for the design.

- It will have users, chatrooms and messages.
- Users register, and login. They can create chatrooms, delete the ones they create, and participate in specific chatrooms by writing messages.

Post-MVP: I could make a video chat app.

Note: Yesterday I did a basic tutorial on ActionCable, which is the way rails implements websockets. My repo can be found here:

I did this yesterday to see if I would be able to get to MVP by Thursday, and it seems doable
